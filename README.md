# 🌈 AuraLights

**AuraLights** is a beautifully designed SwiftUI-based iOS app inspired by **Apple's HomeKit API** that lets users schedule mood-based ambient lighting experiences. It simulates a smart home light interface where moods like "calm", "energetic", or "sad" trigger dynamic color changes — and can be scheduled for specific times or repeated routines.
